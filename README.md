<h1>Vision-Verse_Hackathon</h1>


Event Description The ML based event that will address the issue of crop monitoring that farmers face every day. It is up to you to create an algorithm and an ML model for a given dataset, which will put your analytical, logical thinking, and coding skills to the test. Farmers all around the world have vast acreages and confront the challenge of crop monitoring on a regular basis. To design an algorithm that would assist them in monitoring their crops and in informing farmers about crop health. There is a device available that monitors the crops automatically and takes photos at regular intervals that would aid them in monitoring their crops and sends the data to farmers and advise them about their crop health. According to health, it will classify diseases. To assist with this, you must construct a machine learning model that classifies diseases. To assist you, weâ€™ll be providing you with a dataset with four classifications; now it's up to you to design an ML model.
